# 2. Passive Information Gathering

It’s important to first spend some time browsing the web, looking for background information about the target organization. What do they do? How do they interact with the world? Do they have a sales department? Are they hiring? Browse the organization’s website, and look for general information such as contact information, phone and fax numbers, emails, company structure, and so on. Also, be sure to look for sites that link to the target site, or for company emails floating around the web. Sometimes, it’s the smallest details that give you the most information: how well designed is the target website? How clean is their HTML code? This might give you a clue about their web development budget, which may reflect on their security budget.
