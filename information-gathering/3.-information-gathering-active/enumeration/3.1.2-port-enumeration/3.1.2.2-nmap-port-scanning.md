# 3.1.2.2 Nmap Port Scanning

1. **Accountability of the traffic** : What amount of traffic you are sending out to the network.
2. **Network Sweeping** : Self Explanatory.

* `nmap -sn 10.11.1.1-254`
  * `-sn` ping scan
* `nmap -v -sn 10.11.1.1-254 -oG ping-sweep.txt`
  * `-v` verbose 
  * `-sn` ping scan
  * `-oG` output file in a grepable format, so that we could use grep command easily on the output.
* `nmap -sT -A --top-ports=20 10.11.1.1-254 -oG top-port-sweep.txt`
  * `-sT` connect\(\) scan, complete 3 way handshake
  * `-A` enable all different features during scanning like OS detection, version detection, traceroute.
  * `-top-ports=20` nmap maintain a list of commonly use ports. Here it just uses the top 20 of these common ports.
  * `-oG` grepable output.

3. **OS Fingerprinting** : Operating systems often have slightly different implementations of the TCP/IP stack, such as default TTL values, and TCP window size. These slight differences create a fingerprint which can often be identified by Nmap.

4. **Banner Grabbing \(Service Enumeration\)** : When we scan and probe for open ports, we not only get the response of status of ports, but also additional information. This additional information could help us to identify the underlying service that is running on the port.
