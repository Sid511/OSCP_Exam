# 3.1.6 SMTP Enumeration

* If we have mail server SMTP\(25 default\) port open, we could use different commands to identify if a user's mail id is a valid mail ID or not. This could help us to know the mail ID of different users present in the mail server.
* `VRFY` and `EXPN` are two command we could use for email enumeration

## MIB file in SNMP

* The SNMP Management Information Base \(MIB\) is a database containing information usually related to network management. The database is organized like a tree, where branches represent different organizations or network functions. The leaves of the tree \(final endpoints\) correspond to specific variable values that can then be accessed, and probed, by an external user.

## Use cases of SNMP Enumeration

* We could use the information present in MIB File to ask the different SNMP devices \(servers, applications, routers, etc\) to share the configuration details. This let us to know internal details of the different devices. It also tells us about information of the client that uses that information.
