# 3.2 Fuzzing

Fuzzing involves sending malformed data into application input and watching for unexpected crashes.

Fuzzing is like an art to me. It is not of everybody's taste. To me this is the most difficult part. It involves two things.

1. Software/Web app testing.
2. You should be aware of how technology works at assembly level.

You need experience in both software testing and pentesting to fuzz.
