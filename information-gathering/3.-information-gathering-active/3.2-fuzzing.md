# 3.2 Fuzzing

Fuzzing is like an art to me. It is not of everybody's taste. To me this is the most difficult part. It involves two things.

1. Software/Web app testing.
2. You should be aware of how technology works at assembly level.

You need experience in both software testing and pentesting to fuzz.
