# 7.2 File Inclusion Vulnerabilities

* These are seen in web applications which run using PHP and are poorly coded. It depends on PHP version and webserver configurations in php.ini such as:
  * Register global 
  * allow URL option
* To include either remote or local .php files into the URL wrapper and executing the scripts.

## 7.2.1 Remote File Inclusion

* Requirements
  * enable "allow\_url\_fopen"
  * enable "allow\_url\_include"
* Running .php from from client/attacker system in to the PHP server. 
* These are more harmful exploits. 
* RFI using LFI.
  * Given that the requirements are not met for RFI.
  * We First somehow send malicious code to the victim machine. Here we have used the [log transfer method](../4.-file-transfer/#list-of-different-ways-for-transferring-a-file).
  * We use a common method for ease of the RFI attack. As below:
    * We introduce a new variable in URL \("cmd"\). We fill the variable with our desired command that need to be executed.
    * Using RFI we tell the server to user this URL parameter and execute the text in "cmd" variable.
      * `<?php echo shell_exec($_GET['cmd']);?>`

## 7.2.2 Local File Inclusion

* No such requirements, these type of attacks occurs due to bad desgin on PHP website.
* Running .php file already present in the victim PHP server.
