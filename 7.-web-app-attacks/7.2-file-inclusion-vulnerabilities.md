# 7.2 File Inclusion Vulnerabilities

* These are seen in web applications which run using PHP and are poorly coded. It depends on PHP version and webserver configurations in php.ini such as:
  * Register global 
  * allow URL option
* To include either remote or local .php files into the URL wrapper and executing the scripts.

## 7.2.1 File Traversal vulnerability

* Step 0 : "http://192.168.1.1/site.php?page=firstpage". This means site is vulnerable to local file inclusion.
* Step 1 : http://192.168.1.1/site.php?page=..%2F.%2F.%2F.%2F.%2F.%2F.%2F.%2F.%2Fetc%2Fpasswd%00
* Step 2 : If we are able to perform this file traversal, that means we could perform local file inclusion.
* Step 3: Now we could proceed for remote file inclusion.

## 7.2.2 Remote File Inclusion

* Requirements
  * enable "allow\_url\_fopen"
  * enable "allow\_url\_include"
* Running .php from from client/attacker system in to the PHP server. 
* These are more harmful exploits. 
* RFI using LFI.
  * Given that the requirements are not met for RFI.
  * We First somehow send malicious code to the victim machine. Here we have used the [log transfer method](../4.-file-transfer/#list-of-different-ways-for-transferring-a-file).
  * We use a common method for ease of the RFI attack. As below:
    * We introduce a new variable in URL \("cmd"\). We fill the variable with our desired command that need to be executed.
    * Using RFI we tell the server to user this URL parameter and execute the text in "cmd" variable.
      * `<?php echo shell_exec($_GET['cmd']);?>`

## 7.2.3 Local File Inclusion

* No such requirements, these type of attacks occurs due to bad desgin on PHP website.
* Running .php file already present in the victim PHP server.
