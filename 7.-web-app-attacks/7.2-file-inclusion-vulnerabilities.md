# 7.2 File Inclusion Vulnerabilities

* These are seen in web applications which run using PHP and are poorly coded. It depends on PHP version and webserver configurations in php.ini such as:
  * Register global 
  * allow URL option
* To include either remote or local .php files into the URL wrapper and executing the scripts.

## 7.2.1 Remote File Inclusion

* Requirements
  * enable "allow\_url\_fopen"
  * enable "allow\_url\_include"
* Running .php from from client/attacker system in to the PHP server. 
* These are more harmful exploits. 

## 7.2.2 Local File Inclusion

* No such requirements, these type of attacks occurs due to bad desgin on PHP website.
* Running .php file already present in the victim PHP server.
