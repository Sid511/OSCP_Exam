# 5. Searching for exploits

There are two source of verified exploits.

1. [Exploit database](https://www.exploit-db.com/). Offline copy of the database is present in kali linux "searchsploit".
2. [SecurityFocus](https://www.securityfocus.com/)

## Why I am not able to find a working exploit?

* many \(if not most\) of the public exploits found on the Internet will not work, straight out of the box. Weâ€™ll find everything from wrong offsets, return addresses intended for different operating systems or patch levels, and bad code.
* Many times you may find exploit, where the reverse shellcode is hardcoded, which means the return address of the reverse shell may not be valid for your IP address against what was written by the designer.
* exploits might be one shots, like say if we run the exploit it crashes linux system, and we need to restart the system. In this case, you have to carefully set the proper parameter, hence one shot.

## Solution!

So before directly executing the exploit, set up a test environment consisting of the vulnerable application. You perform a through testing until the exploit is successful.

## Another problem, Various Exploit Code Languages, cross platform compatibility

* languages such as C and C++ have different flavors between Linux/Unix and Windows, and this code is often not cross-compatible
* python, java and other exploits.

## Behavior of Exploits

* Generally exploit consists of shellcode, so if the shellcode is not that powerful we may wish to replace it with some other powerful shell code. This approach may not help if shell code is written considering DEP and ASLR.
