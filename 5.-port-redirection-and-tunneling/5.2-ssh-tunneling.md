# 5.2 SSH Tunneling

There are two ways of SSH tunneling

1. Local port forwarding using SSH protocol
2. Remote port forwarding using SSH protocol

## SSH Local Port forwarding

* On our client machine we will open URL _http://127.0.0.1:8080_.
* Note that 8080 = 80. Actually by 8080 we are just asking to use http service.
* This request will be internally tunneled on port 53 by configured SSH tunnel.
* We have a similar relay server which helps as communicator.

### SSH Remote Port forwarding

* Given we RDP ports are not allowed through firewall means 3389 and 2290 are blocked at firewall level.
* And given only port 53 is allowed.
* Given that the victim machine has RDP services active and running on port 3389.
* We will use SSH port tunneling technique to talk directly to the server. We do not need relay server in this kind of exploits.
