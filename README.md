5. So these notes are not the complete knowledge.
6. You have to go through the links to get the complete picture.
7. Feel free to comment in case you have confusion related to any article.
8. Through out the book, i have only given practical code, that I ran and executed successfully. Please understand the code and adjust arguments according to your need. The point of such codes is the practical realization.
