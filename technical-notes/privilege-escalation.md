# Privilege Escalation

There could be two ways we could get to execute code in  higher privilege.

1. **Privilege Escalation exploit** : These exploit work to elevate your privileges in some way on the victim machine, by successfully exploiting an existing vulnerability.
2. **Privilege Escalation exploit** _\(local privilege escalation\)_ : We mostly refer to this when we say "privilege escalation exploit". Given we know that an application is running with root privileges, using some way we try to inject our malicious code and try to execute that code via the application. In this way our code gets executed with root privileges.
