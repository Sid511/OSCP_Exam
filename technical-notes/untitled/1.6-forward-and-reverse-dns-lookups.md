# 1.6 Forward and Reverse DNS lookups

## Forward DNS lookup

To satisfy Forward DNS lookup queries we have a forward lookup zone.

This is what we mean by simply "DNS lookup". For example we give a domain name "google.com" as input and we get output as "216.10.10.10". Forward lookup zones is where the normal records go.

* Forward lookup zones consists of host record file or zone files, which maps domain names to IP address.
* Similarly other record types like MX records, service records, etc are present in forward lookup zones.

## Reverse DNS lookup

To satisfy Reverse DNS lookup queries we have a reverse lookup zone.

We give IP address as input "216.10.10.10" and get output as "google.com". This is call reverse DNS lookup

* For reverse DNS lookup we need **PTR record**.
* To have reverse lookup, you need to setup a **reverse lookup zone**.
